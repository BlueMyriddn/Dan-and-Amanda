Amanda was bold enough to ride the "High Roller" a rollercoaster that is situated on the top of the Stratosphere.  We had done the NY,NY rollercoaster the day before so I was kinda rollercoastered out - I am not a big fan of them.  Amanda was really nervous about doing this one as we were looking out the windows at just how high up we were.  Ended up being a really gentle ride though - just sort of curved around the top of the tower.</td></tr>
