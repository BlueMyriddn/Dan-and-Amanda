<font color="white"><b>The Aquarium had a few of these tunnels giving you a great view of the aquatic life.  We had one really cool experience where a Sandtiger Shark swam right above us displaying its hallmark protruding teeth.  They are unique in sharks in how they catch their meals - it is an almost delicate process where they swim very slowly into a school of fish.  This contrasts sharply with the typical shark style which is an agressive sawing back and forth with quick darting motions of their entire body.</b></font>
