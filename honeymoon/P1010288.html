Vegas is full of celebrities.  Oh ok, you got us, its a Wax Museum.  I guess we should have tried to fake you with someone that is still alive huh?  Madame Tussaud's is attached directly to our hotel so it was a short walk there.  We were able to get free passes from a jewelry store owner that Amanada chatted up in the pool.  Just goes to show that being friendly here and there really does pay.</td></tr>
