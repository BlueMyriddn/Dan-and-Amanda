<h1>About Us</h1>

Dan and Amanda met at Cornell University in 1994.  She was a freshman and he was a junior.  When they met, Amanda was waiting for one of his fraternity brothers to take her on a date and Dan was lounging around telling jokes to the freshman girl who was folding his laundry.  Amanda was instantly attracted to Dan’s quirky sense of humor and although Dan says it was Amanda’s eyes which first attracted him, she’s pretty sure it was the fact that she laughed at his jokes (even the really bad ones).<br><br>

Their first date was at Risley Theatre to see Shakespeare’s <u>The Tempest</u>.  Ironically, <u>The Tempest</u> has exactly 9 scenes, and it took Dan 9 years to ask Amanda to marry him…but who’s counting?  Though it may have taken a long time in coming, their engagement was incredibly romantic.  They were vacationing in the Florida Keys and had spent an amazing day on Key West doing everything from climbing the lighthouse to squirting sea cucumbers.  At the end of the day they wandered down to the boardwalk to watch the street performers set up for the sunset show and Dan surprised Amanda by proposing. <a href="/keywest/">[link to pictures]</a><br><br>

You may be asking, “Why in the world are they getting married in Geneva!?”  Dan and Amanda shared their first apartment in Geneva and created a number of unforgettable memories there.  This apartment in the old row-house district was a memory in itself.  The entire row house, which was built into the side of a hill, had “settled” over the years so that a marble placed at the front of the apartment, would roll downhill to the back of the apartment and then slip through a large separation between the floor and the wall and land in the apartment below.  Belhurst Castle in Geneva is where Dan and Amanda’s parents met for the first time, so getting married in Geneva seemed like a nice way to tie together something which had begun there.<br><br>

Dan and Amanda’s relationship has seen a number of changes since it began in the fall of 1994.  Amanda went from being a physics major to a biochemist and Dan went from being a biology major to a computer graphic designer.  They’ve added a wonderful dog and many amazing friends to their lives (not necessarily in that order) and they’ve ended up spending MUCH more time in Ithaca than either had ever intended.  It has truly been an exciting journey and fun learning experience.<br><br>

Currently, Amanda is working on her PhD in Biochemistry doing research on something that has to do with retroviruses and Dan is doing something that involves putting annual reports and proxy statements on the web (we hope we didn't bore you with the details).<br><br>

We look forward to sharing our wedding with our friends and family.  You have all contributed so much to our relationship and to our lives over the years.  We thank you for your love and support and look forward to seeing you all again soon!
