<h1>The Reception</h1>
To determine who would win the table centerpiece (goldfish included), the DJ had folks pass a dollar bill around.  The winner got the dollar and the person who originally donated the dollar got the fishbowl.  Dave Williamson celebrates his victory (I don't think he wanted the fish)
