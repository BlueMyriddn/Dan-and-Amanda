<h1>The Reception</h1>
Most of all, Amanda and I had a great time and want to thank everyone who made the event a success including our Parents, family, the Belhurst staff, our DJ Steve Turner, our photographer Steve Chesler and his lovely assistant, and the many good friends who came to share the day with us.
