The biggest thing that was slowing down our painting was the big holes in our wall from the electrical work we had done.  I just kept on pushing off repairing that wall even though it really wasn't that big of a project.  It was simply a matter of <p>1) cutting out drywall patches and securing them to the wall  <br>2) taping and plastering over them to seal them in to the wall  <br>3) sanding it down to smooth the wall.</td><td align="center">

<tr><td><h2>Stage 2:  Tape the Kitchen</h2>

I am a fairly neat painter, but with all the cabinets and tight spots, we really needed to do a decent amount of taping.  Fortunately Amanda is an expert taper after our bedroom project and she literally bent over backwards to get the taping done in the Kitchen.

<tr><td><h2>Stage 3:  Paint</h2>

As expected, the actual painting went fast with the first coat getting done on Sunday and the second coat going on Monday.  Now there is just a little bit left including some detail work where I coulnd't quite get the paint cut in close enough.

<tr><td><h2>Stage 4:  Finalize and detail work</h2>

Still under construction, but we are looking to edge in a few corners, get new faceplates and some new drapes and then we will have a new kitchen!
